The most valuable programming skill I learned this year is how to use online APIs. I had encountered them before but not really understood how they work and how to use them, but in this class I learned about what the header is, etc. I have ideas for a couple of projects I would love to create, such as a custom app for Schoology, which would heavily utilize APIs, and the intro to them in this class gave me the solid foundation to use them that I lacked before.

The most valuable non-CS skill that I learned is about planning. I have often jumped straight into projects and assignments without good foresight or an idea of the structure, which left me to flounder and either not finish or not do well on the task. However, this class showed me a number of times how much better my work will be with a little bit of planning and preparation. I now make sure to plan out the structure and content of my essays, projects, and other tasks, which has proven to be a very worthwhile exercise.
