Israel Education is a very vague term. The name Israel refers to a number of different things. As well, “education” can mean very different things. Hanan Alexander, a professor at the University of Haifa, wrote an essay in the Journal of Jewish Education in which he described a better way to view Zionism and how it should be a basis of Israel Education. Bethamie Horowitz, a researcher about Jewish learning at various institutions, published the result of a study that adds some depth to Alexander’s (2015) ideas of Israel Education. Finally, Elliott Abrams,  a scholar of Middle Eastern Studies, discusses the way that American Jews have been growing distanced from Israel, and why that’s the case. Putting together these sources, an idea of Israel Education emerges, which entails a process of learning about the modern State of Israel, in which students learn about the good and bad parts of Israeli culture and history, examine the biases in the sources they learn and in themselves, and listen to and learn from opposing viewpoints in a mature and respectful manner, in order to strengthen their bond with the land and the people who live there.
Hanan Alexander’s (2015) article creates a basis of Israel Education. He supplies the idea that there are two types of Zionism: Romantic Zionism, which is a love for Israel which overlooks all flaws or negative aspects of Israel, and Mature Zionism, which is a support for Israel which loves the positive aspects of Israel while also recognizing the negative aspects and being open to -or even providing- critiques of its culture, leadership, and more. As Alexander (2015) says, “[Mature Zionists] should acknowledge Israel’s challenges as well as its accomplishments—not to diminish its legitimacy, but to maintain the relationship over time” (p. 140). In order to have a strong and healthy relationship with the State of Israel, you must see all the sides of Israel – the good as well as the bad. Maintaining a relationship with only some parts of Israel cannot last.
Alexander (2015) also says that Israel Education can only be productive with a background and perspective of Mature Zionism. Otherwise, some of the most important parts of Israel Education will not be taught or learnt – Israel Education requires teaching the good with the bad. Furthermore, Alexander (2015) requires students of Israel Education to be open to viewpoints and opinions other than their own. Students must be able to see the other side of an argument and reason with them respectfully. They must be able to critique others’ opinions without insulting them or writing off, and they must be able to receive criticism without being insulted; in fact, these students must use criticism to strengthen their arguments. If they find they cannot bolster their arguments, they must be prepared to reconsider their opinions (Alexander, 2015).
Bethamie Horowitz’s (2012) study can be used to build on that basis. She argues that there are four different types of education about Israel, each with a different audience and goals. Importantly, she separates Israel Studies from Israel Education; Israel Studies being secular research about Israel, usually in an academic context, while Israel Education is teaching and learning about Israel in the context of a personal bond with the Land, and in order to build and strengthen a bond with the State. Israel Education is directed specifically at Jews, who have a religious connection to Israel. It has no specific target, but rather can include both children and adults, because people of any age can build a bond with the Land and State of Israel.
Elliott Abrams (2016) discusses the aspect of Israel Education that involves a bond to the land and country. He writes about two different books that attempt to understand why the bond between American Jews and Israel seems to be weakening, which take two different tacks, and then he adds his own opinion. He discusses Dov Waxman’s book, Trouble in the Tribe, and Michael Barnett’s book, The Star and the Stripes. As Abrams (2016) summarizes Waxman’s book, he essentially says that American Jews are increasingly disagreeing with the decisions that Israel makes, and don’t like that Israel is becoming more and more conservative and isolated (Waxman, 2016, as cited in Abrams, para. 10). American Jews see that Israel is growing more and more religious, which means that secular Americans feel alienated from it, and also that Israel itself is becoming more alienated from secular or Muslim countries. Abrams (2016) seems to like Barnett’s book better. He discusses how Barnett puts the discussion in historical context, where non-Orthodox Jews generally tend to think of Jews in terms of society as a whole, while Orthodox Jews focus on preserving Orthodox Judaism regardless of people on the outside. In this context, the Jews who had the deepest bond with the Land or State of Israel have already moved there. Those remaining in America, while they do care deeply about Israel, are not as invested as Jews living in Israel. American Jews will certainly show their support in times of need, and send supplies and funds when asked, but they clearly are not as connected to Israel as the Jews who decided it was more important than anything else in their lives to move to Israel (Barnett, 2016, as cited in Abrams, 2016, para. 18).
Abrams (2016) entirely disagrees with both of these perspectives. Instead of blaming the distance between American Jews and Israel on Israel, he says that the American community is the reason for it. Abrams (2016) notes that American Jews have seemingly been on the fast-track for assimilation. One of the largest tells of that is assimilation, which has been on a very steep rise among American Jews. Jews who do not feel very connected to Judaism often do not prioritize marrying other Jews, which also means that their children might not be raised with a very strong connection to Judaism either. Even aside from intermarriage, more and more Jews are disconnected from Judaism; these Jews do not go to synagogue, celebrate the holidays, or live in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. These are all symptoms of an issue where Jews are becoming distanced from Judaism. Just one more symptom of this is a disconnect with Israel. Israel is the Jewish state, and most people’s connection to it is via Judaism, and with a disconnect from Judaism comes a disconnect from Israel – it becomes just another religious state in the Middle East. (Abrams, 2016)
This is why Israel Education is so important. According to Ms Horowitz, the primary goal of Israel Education is to build up a person’s connection to Israel. The increasing amount of information that is accessible online means that more Israel Education is necessary, not less. More information is certainly at our fingertips but so is misinformation. Israel Education is needed in order to teach people the facts and to help them identify what’s true and what’s false for themselves. Building a connection to Israel is also part of building a connection with Judaism; these two issues are linked, and if both connections are strengthened, they will strengthen each other.
Personally, I believe that my relationship with Israel should be classified as Mature Zionism. I am certainly in support of the theoretical existence of a Jewish State in the Land of Israel, and in fact I believe that the current state is justified in its existence. However, I realize that in the modern history of the State of Israel, there are many evils and wrongdoings that have been done in the name of (and by) the State of Israel. My relationship is Mature because I love the State, but I also recognize such wrongdoings. I am in a position where I am able to say that I do not agree with parts of Israel’s history, because I think they were mistakes or morally bad. I believe that Zionism is a good thing, and that any certain people deserve to have a safe state in the place that they choose (this is just a dream, and I doubt that it is actually practically possible).
Certainly, my previous education has had an impact on this stance of mine. I have a family that talks about politics and history a good amount, Israeli as well as American. I also keep myself educated on many subjects, including Israeli politics and history. I do this by reading news articles, watching YouTube videos, and more. I do not just pick articles or videos that are likely to report from a similar political stance as myself. In fact, I often pick ones from the opposite stance, in order to hear what they have to say. I often end up with criticism of their method or delivery, but I still keep my mind open to learn about what they have to say. I have also engaged in many conversations and debates with friends and acquaintances, weighing the pros and cons and various consequences of different moments of Israeli history. In such debates, I stood behind my opinions, but also listened to the opinions of those who disagreed, and when I found their arguments compelling, I did reconsider my opinions.
My experience and outlook so far works very well with the proposed Israel Education of Alexander, Horowitz, and Abrams. Alexander (2015) says that Zionism and Israel Education should accept the bad things about Israel as well as the good if it wants to achieve any sort of meaningful goal. As well, every student needs to listen to all other viewpoints without insulting them. Horowitz (2012) shows that Israel Education needs to be in pursuit of a personal connection with Israel. Abrams (2016) explains that the growing divide between American Jews and Israel is the lack of connection, which leads to seeing Israel in a more neutral or negative light than positive. I believe that I already do all these things, and plan on continuing to do so as I learn more.
